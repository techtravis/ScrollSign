# ScrollSign
Program to Run Custom Built Scroll Sign

Based off the C++ library by https://github.com/adafruit/RGB-matrix-Panel 

It utilizes VisualGDB so that I can develop it in visual studio and then easily build/debug directly to the raspberrypi

Uses RSS Feeds to feed the display of the LED Sign
